# Loopy
Sample MVVM Windows application.
Loopy loops through integers between an upper and lower bound you specify. 
You can configure it to replace multiples of a given integer with text you specify; optionally, you can specify a color for the replacement text.
Out of the box, it is configured to replace multiples of 3 with "Goldy" and multiples of 7 with "Gopher".

Dependencies: Loopy requires .NET Framework 4.7.2.
Loopy.exe requires the config file Loopy.exe.config in the same folder.

To run: Download Loopy.exe.zip and unzip the contents to a folder of your choice. Run Loopy.exe.
